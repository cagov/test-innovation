<p class="emphasized">The Office of Digital Innovation’s (ODI) mission is to help state government deliver better services to the people of California. To do this, we created the Digital Innovation Fund (DIF).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The DIF fosters collaboration between ODI and state agencies, departments, and offices. These entities can now submit applications for DIF projects to address complex problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The DIF can help you if:</p>

<ul><li>You’re struggling to get IT solutions or business process improvement services within delegated authority,</li><li>You need help improving your customers’ experience,&nbsp;</li><li>You need to find the “why” behind the challenges you face, or</li><li>You want to learn more about your users and what they actually need.</li></ul>

<h2>What the DIF does&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The DIF funds collaboration between your agency and ODI. It helps teams like yours identify, understand, and solve business problems. The DIF offers a way forward whether you:</p>

<ul><li>Have a solution in mind,</li><li>Have a contract already signed, or</li><li>Aren’t sure where or how to get started.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>Through the DIF, ODI can work with you to:</p>

<ol><li>Use market research to identify, vet, or confirm possible solutions,</li><li>Explore the problem through discovery to create a clear, data-informed problem definition,</li><li>Identify opportunities for business process improvements and organizational changes,</li><li>Help buy IT solutions or services within your delegated spending authority, or</li><li>Build a minimum viable product with ODI design, development, and implementation.</li></ol>

<p>What the DIF doesn’t do:</p>

<ul><li>Fund solutions without collaboration, or</li><li>Jump to solutions without engaging the people affected.</li></ul>

<h2>Good DIF candidates&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<h3>Partners</h3>

<p>A good DIF partner is:</p>

<p></p>

<ul><li>Hands-on,</li><li>Collaborative</li><li>Transparent</li><li>Willing to experiment, and</li><li>Curious about new methods and techniques.</li></ul>

<p>They have a good understanding of the problem and its root causes, but they aren’t sure what the solution might be. They are excited to use data to better understand the problem and inform solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>A good DIF project will have a significant impact. It may help Californians live healthier, safer, more secure lives. Or it may help state staff do their jobs more effectively, with less stress and better outcomes. And it has been approved by executive leadership or the Agency Information Officer.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Outcomes&nbsp;</h3>

<p>A good DIF outcome solves a problem that has a meaningful impact on the people we serve.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How the DIF process works&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The intake process is like CDT’s <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/tmf/">Technology Modernization Fund</a> (TMF) process. A DIF Advisory Committee of ODI staff will review submissions and make recommendations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the review, the committee will focus on the problem statement. We will also gauge department readiness, and the project’s impact and feasibility. The intake questionnaire will give us the information needed to make these assessments.</p>

<p>Project approval is up to the DIF Selection Committee. This committee is the same as the TMF Selection Committee, and its members are department undersecretaries.</p>
