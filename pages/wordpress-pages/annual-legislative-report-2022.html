<h2>Projects and products&nbsp;</h2>

<h3>COVID-19 Response</h3>

<h4>State website COVID-19 survey</h4>

<p>In partnership with the California Office of Emergency Services (OES), ODI designed, fielded, and managed a voluntary survey to gather data directly from Californians about their attitudes, needs, concerns, actions and inactions around COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccines.</p>

<p>The survey was placed on 12 of the most visited state websites and ran continuously from January 28-September 8, 2021. The survey gathered 144,024 structured responses and 124,269 open-ended responses. ODI applied standard survey methodology to the respondent sample to make it reflect the state’s demographic distribution. This approach of tapping into state website traffic to gather voluntary data from Californians is an innovative, cost-effective, easily replicable way to gather real-time data, at scale, about any issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Vaccine Response Research, Data &amp; Analytics&nbsp;</h4>

<p>At the request of OES, ODI leveraged the data collected by the state website COVID-19 survey, to inform the state’s equity-based, geo-targeted vaccine distribution. As part of this effort, ODI developed and delivered multiple products to help identify and address friction points in vaccine uptake, including:&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Vaccine Hesitancy Zip Code Scoring Model</h5>

<p>ODI built a vaccine sentiment scoring model that allowed decision makers to find locations where vaccination uptake was low but willingness was high. This model leveraged multiple data sets in addition to the state website COVID-19 survey data, including Healthy Places Index, Census, digital engagement data from different ca.gov websites including myturn.ca.gov, and vaccination rates data. The final product provided an understanding of the hesitancy and willingness statewide at the county, city and zip code levels. The data was regularly validated against the Carnegie Mellon/Facebook COVIDCast data set. ODI delivered bi-weekly data updates with the newest scores to stakeholders.</p>

<h5>Qualitative Analysis Dashboard</h5>

<p>ODI built out an analyst-level dashboard that allowed analysts to explore and quantify the open-ended data in relation to key factors like geography, race/ethnicity, and age. It was used by TPA analysts and ODI to provide deeper insight into the most common concerns and barriers to getting vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Topic Modeling Dashboard</h5>

<p>ODI used Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, and Topic Modeling to analyze parts of speech, sentiment, and “toxicity” of these data allowing us to identify the dominant topics, the sentiment around those topics, and changes as they occurred.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These products were used by multiple stakeholders:</p>

<ol><li>TPA analysts and Local Health Jurisdictions used the qualitative and scoring data to help inform mobile and pop-up vaccine deployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Duncan Channon, the Vaccinate All 58 ad agency, used the scoring data to help inform ad targeting and message development.</li><li>CORD, the COVID Outreach Rapid Deployment tool used by state-contracted CBOs, used the scoring data to help inform direct engagement.</li></ol>

<h4>COVID-19 website (covid19.ca.gov)</h4>

<p>ODI continues to maintain Covid19.ca.gov, playing a central role in the coordination and distribution of COVID-related information and guidance. ODI collaborates with multiple agencies to make updates to the site on a sometimes daily basis. For example, between January and December of 2021, ODI made 38,882 GitHub commits to covid19.ca.gov. Each commit represents an update to the website. These changes range in scale from routine daily data updates to the launch of new pages or charts in response to changing circumstances Below are three examples that reflect the complexity and variety of the Covid19.ca.gov site changes:&nbsp;</p>

<ol><li>Based on feedback from Californians, ODI developed, tested and iterated on the extremely popular “What&#8217;s Open” search tool. Before it was retired, it covered 125 types of businesses or activities, with four statuses each, depending on local conditions, so Californians could learn what was happening in their communities.</li><li>ODI revamped the entire Covid19 site to support the state’s reopening on June 15 including removing the Blueprint for a Safer Economy. This major overhaul was delivered on time and seamlessly from the user’s perspective, resulting in almost no negative user feedback.&nbsp;</li><li>ODI created and innovated new ways to make data visualizations accessible, including developing and launching the state Dashboard, creating the Trackerbox with mini, lightweight charts that load quickly and are easily scanned, and creating charts comparing COVID cases, tests, and deaths between vaccinated and unvaccinated people.</li></ol>

<h3>Procurement</h3>

<p>As part of ODI’s mandate to “rethink and improve how the state buys digital services,” procurement is a focus area for the organization. Knowing how, when, and what to procure helps departments and vendor partners create and manage digital solutions and is central to digital transformation. The three priority areas for ODI in this fiscal year included:&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Technology, Digital and Data Consulting Master Service Agreement</h4>

<p>The TDDC MSA is a key asset to modernize how the State contracts out for professional services to make the experience of government more human-centered, data-driven, secure and digitally available. ODI worked in partnership with the Department of General Services (DGS), GovOps, and the Department of Technology to help develop new digital service and data consulting opportunities for the IT Consulting Master Service Agreement (MSA), renamed the Technology, Digital, and Data MSA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Some highlights include :</p>

<ul><li>16 new classifications including data scientist, data engineer, content designer, UX researcher, UX designer, product manager, among others.</li><li>Proactive outreach to small/women/minority-owned businesses, many of whom are new to contracting with government.&nbsp;</li><li>Many other jurisdictions are watching and want to learn from California&#8217;s procurement efforts for digital/data roles.</li></ul>

<h4>Credit Card acceptance and fee reduction</h4>

<p>In partnership with Caltrans, the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, and GovOps, ODI also supported a successful initiative to make it more affordable for public transit agencies to accept credit cards directly on buses, light rails and metros. ODI analyzed an existing survey of digital payments by state departments and led a second survey to better understand which programs accepted credit card payments, which did not and what support might be needed to increase adoption.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Small Business Procurement User Research&nbsp;</h4>

<p>In collaboration with GovOps and DGS, ODI interviewed dozens of buyers in state departments and small businesses already contracting with the state and several who wish to. We engaged in stakeholder discussions with groups like the Minority-Owned Small Business Procurement Task Force, incorporating a diverse range of experiences and backgrounds in our research. This work is supporting ongoing work by DGS and GovOps to increase small business participation in state procurements.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Cannabis website (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CBXY6NzS0MA3gNN9hsTV16_CsFXLYEM5n7vAlQX_WhI/edit#heading=h.ijiv4bdkk3z5">cannabis.ca.gov</a>)</h3>

<p>Building on the Design System, as well as leveraging reusable, scalable tools and assets that ODI developed for other projects like covid19.ca.gov, and working in partnership with CDT and the new Department of Cannabis Control (DCC), ODI built and launched cannabis.ca.gov in just two months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior to the creation of DCC and the new website, people were required to visit multiple websites to find information on cannabis licensing or regulations. Information was often duplicative and confusing and finding definitive answers was difficult. The process and technology was complicated and not serving end user needs.</p>

<p>The new site provides a new, one-stop location for all California-specific marijuana information by bringing together and distilling information from the Department of Public Health, the Department of Food and Agriculture, the Bureau of Cannabis Control, under the banner of the newly created Department of Cannabis Control (DCC).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Drought website (<a href="http://drought.ca.gov">drought.ca.gov</a>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>ODI built and launched <a href="http://drought.ca.gov">drought.ca.gov</a> in less than a week by leveraging the Design System and lessons learned from alpha.ca.gov and covid.ca.gov.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>By deploying a Headless Architecture. ODI created a faster, more accessible and flexible site than it could have using traditional tools. This has resulted in ranking X in a speed test of state websites.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<h4>Content Design Training</h4>

<p>ODI launched the Design System Content Design Principles at the California Department of Technology Digital Web Services Network. ODI is partnering with the the Department of Toxic Substances Control and CalRecycle to conduct a training for 150 content writers. This work will continue and expand in the year ahead.</p>

<h4>Website Analytics Training</h4>

<p>ODI developed and delivered website analytics training on Google Analytics for the Victims Compensation Board and the Department of Cannabis Control. ODI delivered written materials and in-person (Zoom) sessions. As a result, both departments are now using Google Analytics dashboards to better understand and respond to the needs of users who visit their sites.[confirm if this is correct]</p>

<h3>Research, Data and Analytics</h3>

<h4>Expanded Broadband Benefits User Research&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Working in collaboration with the Public Utilities Commission, ODI developed and implemented a research plan to understand the barriers facing Californians when trying to access the EBB.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over six weeks, ODI conducted 60 interviews. The resulting report included a series of six recommendations from making the password hints more prominent in a mobile device view to adding a help note not to use a single initial as a middle name. The EBB program implemented these recommendations, making it easier for Californians (and all eligible Americans) to apply for discounted broadband service. To date, California is the only state that has undertaken this type of research in relation to the EBB.</p>

<h4>Cross-Eligibility Proof of Concept</h4>

<p>Working in collaboration with the Employment Development Department, and the California Department of Social Services, ODI modeled a scalable and easily replicable approach to bridge across available benefits by making a strong connection for UI claimants to the&nbsp; CalFresh program, which food assistance benefits for Californians. Using data and analytics, ODI identified a high-visibility location inside UIOnline (the UI claimant web site), which every UI claimant must log into every two weeks, and placed an optimized call to action and link for CalFresh. Using simple but informative language informed by behavioral science — such as including the specific dollar amount that applicants could be eligible for — the cross-enrollment connection proved very successful.&nbsp; Traffic and actions were measured end-to-end: from pageview to click to application submission and approval for benefits, allowing for real-time monitoring, identification of potential risks, and iteration.</p>

<p>This Proof of Concept directly increased the number of CalFresh applicants by ~130,000 by the end of June 2021. To-date, this connection (paired with additional links placed elsewhere on the EDD web site) has led to more than 200,000 successful new CalFresh applications.</p>

<h3>Language Access&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Recognizing the need to expand accessibility beyond current practices across the state, ODI is collaborating with the Language Access Task Force to explore how the state can use digital tools and methods to expand accessibility through language.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Language Task Force Legal Survey&nbsp;</h4>

<p>ODI designed and fielded a SurveyMonkey poll of all Language Access Task Force members to gather data about how specific state agencies and departments provide language assistance through online forms, interpretation services, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Building For the Future</h3>

<h4>California Design System</h4>

<p>There are currently over 300 active California state government websites, and while there is some standardization and consistency, the user experience varies significantly from site to site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an effort to help departments move toward user-focused website and service design and improve the user experience, ODI is leading a collaborative effort with the California Department of Technology (CDT) to develop an MVP&nbsp; CA Design System and will begin testing it with more departments in the next fiscal year.</p>

<p>The CA Design System is a coherent and inter-related set of principles, styles guides, and patterns, including scalable, reusable components and assets. It builds on ODI’s alpha.ca.gov project [LINK] and CDT’s state web standards and state website template.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Core to the system is the fact that each of its elements is rooted in an actual need that has been vetted by UX research and put through a design validation process. It offers scalable, reusable tools that departments can use to improve access to services.</p>

<p>The Design System both informs and is informed by the work ODI is doing to develop new websites.</p>

<p>In addition to technical assets like a library of performant, easy to install, and easy to interact with components, ODI has also created and begun to share for feedback Content Design and Research Principles and Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Estimated beta launch for the CA Design System is January 2022. ODI is developing goals and metrics to measure the Design System’s uptake and inform continued iteration of its components.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>ODI Publishing System</h4>

<p>Similar to the Design System, and in partnership with CDT, ODI has experimented with new ways to deliver information state web resources in consistent, performant, and accessible ways.</p>

<p>To support this work, ODI is developing a new publishing system prototype designed to offer state website administrators innovative and experimental options for building new sites and iterating on older ones. ODI publishing is rooted in the Design System principles of accessibility and replicability. It is designed to be regularly iterated on and provide a testing ground for new technologies, working collaboratively across state departments. In addition to the principles and guidelines of the Design System articulated above, examples of ODI Publishing assets include, custom Guttenberg design blocks and decoupled or “headless” site architecture components.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Digital Innovation Services Revolving Fund</h2>

<p>ODI encumbered a two year contract with the California Council of Science and Technology in the amount of $1,040,000.00 and transferred $172,000.00 of General Fund overages to the Digital Innovation Services Revolving Fund in fiscal year 2020.</p>
